Kali Tools

1. For Forced Browsing
feroxbuster -u <URL> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 50 -k

=> SSL Certificate Issue
Some apps (like yours) have invalid/misconfigured SSL.
Fix → tell feroxbuster to ignore SSL errors:
feroxbuster -u <URL> -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -t 50 -k

Web cache deception

1. Cache rules are often set up to store static resources, which generally don't change frequently 
and are reused across multiple pages. Dynamic content is not cached as it's more likely to contain sensitive information, 
ensuring users get the latest data directly from the server.
2. Static file extension rules : .css for stylesheets or .js for JavaScript files.
3. Static directory rules : /static or /assets
4.File name rules - These rules match specific file names to target files that are universally required for web operations and 
change rarely, such as robots.txt and favicon.ico

Poin to Rember 
While testing for discrepancies and crafting a web cache deception exploit, make sure that each request you send has a different cache key. 
Otherwise, you may be served cached responses, which will impact your test results.
As both URL path and any query parameters are typically included in the cache key, you can change the key by adding a query string to the 
path and changing it each time you send a request. Automate this process using the Param Miner extension. To do this, once you've installed the extension, 
click on the top-level Param miner > Settings menu, then select Add dynamic cachebuster. Burp now adds a unique query string to every request that you make.
You can view the added query strings in the Logger tab.

Detecting Cached Responses

1. Check X-Cache Header (eg: X-Cache: hit)
   hit → Response served from cache
   miss → Response fetched from origin (send again, may turn into hit)
   dynamic → Content generated dynamically, not cached
   refresh → Cached content was outdated and revalidated

2. Check Cache-Control Header
   Look for public with max-age > 0 → Cacheable resource (not always guaranteed)

3. Compare Response Times
   Fast response → Likely cached
   Slow response → Likely from origin server

SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery)

1. Any URL parameter that is being called internally in a POST request can be tested for SSRF.
2. We can test this by providing a Burp Collaborator URL or by creating a listener using netcat:
   nc -lnvp 8000
   If we receive a hit or callback from the application, then it is vulnerable to SSRF.
3. If the response contains the web application's HTML code, the SSRF vulnerability is not blind,
   i.e., the response is displayed to us.
4. Enumerating the System:
   We can use the SSRF vulnerability to conduct a port scan of the internal system
   to identify running services.

   4.1 Give the URL:
       http://127.0.0.1:81

   4.2 If we supply a port that is closed (such as 81), we get an error message like:
       Failed to connect to port number

   4.3 This allows us to conduct an internal port scan of the web server through the SSRF vulnerability.
       We can automate this using a fuzzer like ffuf.
       First, create a wordlist of ports you want to scan:
           seq 1 10000 > ports.txt

   4.4 Use ffuf to fuzz ports and identify open ones:
       ffuf -w ./ports.txt -u http://URL/index.php -X POST \
       -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
       -d "dateserver=http://127.0.0.1:FUZZ/&date=2024-01-01" \
       -fr "Failed to connect to"

       OR use a custom POST body based on your parameter:
       ffuf -w ./ports.txt -u http://URL/index.php -X POST \
       -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
       -d "<Post Body>" -fr "Error message shown when we try to connect"
